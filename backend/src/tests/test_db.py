To test a PostgreSQL database using `unittest` in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import unittest
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models import Base, User  # Import your models
```

2. Set up the database connection and create a test database:

```python
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/test_db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Replace `user`, `password`, `localhost`, and `test_db` with your own values.

3. Define a `TestCase` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains methods to test your database. For example:

```python
class TestDatabase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.session = Session()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.session.rollback()

    def test_create_user(self):
        user = User(name='John Doe', email='john@example.com')
        self.session.add(user)
        self.session.commit()
        result = self.session.query(User).filter_by(email='john@example.com').first()
        self.assertEqual(result.name, 'John Doe')
```

The `setUp()` method is called before each test method and creates a new session to interact with the database. The `tearDown()` method is called after each test method and rolls back any changes made to the database during the test.

The `test_create_user()` method tests the creation of a new user in the database by adding a new `User` object to the session, committing the transaction, and then querying the database for the user with the specified email address.

4. Run the tests using the `unittest` module:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This will run all the test methods defined in the `TestDatabase` class.

Note that this is just a basic example and there are many other things you can test in a database. You can also use external libraries such as `pytest` or `nose` to make testing easier and more powerful.
